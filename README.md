<i>Hello there fellow humans,</i> my name is Wiffle. I'm someone who's interested in CS, but has difficulty learning. Lately, I've had an urge to learn C#, should I do it? I'm also super into designing anything from characters, to stories, to a world and it's properties. The only problem is I don't have a PC, just a chromebook :( that's why learning CS is difficult for me. I wonder if it's possible for me to accomplish my goals when I don't have what I need.. Well, I won't give up just yet.
